					<p>
						This Privacy Policy describes how your personal
						information is collected, used, and shared when you
						visit or make a purchase from www.Onlinebakehouse.com

						<br />
						<br />
						PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
						<br />
						When you visit the Site, we automatically collect
						certain information about your device, including
						information about your web browser, IP address, time
						zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
						device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect
						information about the individual web pages or products
						that you view, what websites or search terms referred
						you to the Site, and information about how you interact
						with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected
						information as “Device Information”.
						<br />
						<br />
						We collect Device Information using the following
						technologies:
						<br />- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your
						device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
						identifier. For more information about cookies, and how
						to disable cookies, visit
						http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
						<br />- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site,
						and collect data including your IP address, browser
						type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
						and date/time stamps.

						electronic files used to record information about how
						you browse the Site.

						a purchase through the Site, we collect certain
						information from you, including your name, billing
						address, shipping address, payment information
						(including credit card numbers, email address, and phone
						number. We refer to this information as “Order
						Information”.
						<br />
						<br />

						Information and Order Information.
						<br />
						<br />
						HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
						<br />
						We use the Order Information that we collect generally
						to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including

						shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order
						confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order
						Information to:
						<br />- Communicate with you;
						<br />- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud;
						and
						<br />- When in line with the preferences you have
						shared with us, provide you with information or
						advertising relating to our products or services.
						<br />
						<br />
						We use the Device Information that we collect to help us
						screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your
						IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize
						our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how
						our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to
						assess the success of our marketing and advertising
						campaigns).
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />

						<br />
						<br />
						Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to
						comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond
						to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request
						for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our
						rights.
						<br />
						<br />
						BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING
